# DATA-ANALYSIS
CORD-19 Dataset Analysis - Frameworks Assignment
A comprehensive step-by-step analysis of the CORD-19 COVID-19 research dataset, implementing the complete data science workflow from data loading to interactive web application deployment.

🎯 Project Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental data science skills by systematically analyzing the CORD-19 research dataset. Following a structured 5-part approach, we explore COVID-19 research patterns, clean and prepare data, create meaningful visualizations, and build an interactive Streamlit web application.

📚 Learning Objectives Achieved
✅ Data Loading & Exploration: Load and examine real-world datasets
✅ Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and prepare data for analysis
✅ Data Analysis: Perform statistical analysis and pattern recognition
✅ Visualization: Create professional, meaningful charts and plots
✅ Web Development: Build interactive applications with Streamlit
✅ Documentation: Present findings and insights effectively
